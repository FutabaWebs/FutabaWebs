                Yup! You’ve guessed it, I’m creating my own PET! The "Megaman Battle Network" series is what got me into programming. 
                This is a tribute to the game that started it all. It also got me into hacking too! As you can tell already a lot of 
                my projects are heavily themed based. I love bringing what I see to life. Wouldn’t you? Now if only I could bring a 
                certain web slinger to life now that’d be great! Don’t you agree?

                I’m developing a penetration testing app that will incorporate machine learning as well as a “special” feature to create 
                a net navi, or A.I. that will bring my project to life. The first phase is the app. This is a project of projects, leading 
                to the end result, the PET. Project PET is a very special to me and will have all my love poured into it!

                I remember the hardest part of my journey was sitting down and having the discipline to be willing to research, but also anxiety 
                from not knowing where to go.  I spent my first 3 months reading chapter after chapter from various books, making sure I was 
                going over the material over and over and over in order to make sure I truly understood it. It all started with a physical hack, 
                then cracking WPA2 data encryptions via passive online attacks, analyzing browsing data via SQLite database tables in kali linux, 
                etc etc. I became obsessed with learning more and more, giving up sleep, studying and researching around 21 hours a day when I 
                wasn't working, even more so when I began studying for my CEH and Security+ certs, all in order to expand my research.

                I’m developing educational resources that will help people get their foot into the door of Cyber Security, paving a clear 
                path on where to start, and will prep you for the CEH and Security+ Cert. The hardest part about learning anything is knowing 
                where to start. I aim to fix that, and strive to motivate people to pursue cyber security, as well as software engineering in 
                general. The resources I’m working on will cover 11 different programming languages, source code included

                People should have an opportunity to learn and grow in cyber security. I’m strongly against gatekeeping. Over the course of my 
                9 years programming, I’ve always strictly kept a collective of all my research data in case I ever need it. You never know when 
                you might need to refresh. You’ll have access to my research, all hand written by me. Check out my stuff. I give samples.

                Are you a lover of the "Watch Dogs"series? Check out this cool Penetration testing drone I'm working on inspired by 
                Watch Dogs2, a tribute to the series. Think of it as your friendly neighborhood flying wifi-pineapple! The penetration 
                testing drone from the watch dogs series has always fascinated me, so I’ve decided to bring the project to life. I mean, 
                why not? It’s cool! A flying drone that can crack various wireless data encryptions and exfiltrate data. Currently in 
                alpha phase.

                Although I have a love for quadcopters, I’ve always been disappointed by many of them, even DJI ones. Why? Because they 
                don’t really do anything besides look pretty and have a nice camera; Oh and tricks. You pay so much for a drone that 
                doesn’t do so much, and is practically copy and paste across the board. Drones should be out of this world cool. Let’s 
                fix that!

            <p>
                
                The sole purpose of the drone is to fly around capturing packet data, as well as cracking Wireless encryptions, integrating 
                the use of a raspberry pi zero to host my UDP BackDoor Server program in order to communicate with the drone and see what's 
                on the pi as it's flying. When the drone boots up, the pi zero will auto login, where a set of scripts will run, starting up 
                the UDP Server.The flight controller for the drone is built up from scratch, rather than using a pre-built one. The drone will 
                take a series of commands from the transmitter, the controller, also built from scratch (keyboard input option available as well), 
                and depending on the value read from the analog of the joystick module, will move the drone in the desired corresponding direction
