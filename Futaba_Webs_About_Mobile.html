                I’m a self-taught software engineer with a background in cyber security/penetration testing, and have been programming 
                for over 8 years, going on 9 now. One of my specialties is reverse engineering. I like to reverse engineer various core
                API’s and technologies in order to explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life. My favorite 
                video game series known as the MBNS(Megaman Battle Network Series) inspired me to want to learn how to code/program.

            <p>
                
                Futaba_Webs is a new brand I’m starting that focuses on developing a series of unique penetration testing tools with style, 
                both software and hardware wise. I also develop and create educational resources that will help people learn how to program, 
                as well as paint the clear pathway to the cyber security field and all it’s intricacies. The most difficult part of learning 
                anything is knowing where to start.

                My goal right now is to develop and expand my brand, and create a name for myself. I wish to eventually be fully self-employed, 
                which would give me the full opportunity to devote myself to my research and pump out all types of projects to my heart's content. 
                I want to inspire creativity and ingenuity. I want to inspire others to, even if programming is not for them, to be passionate about 
                their respective craft and love and care for it. What you do should be a reflection of yourself. It represents who you are. I hope you 
                tag along my journey and see where life takes me. Lets become the best we can be together. As I learn, you’ll learn. We’ll learn together. 
                Never stop learning. Your support is greatly appreciated and matters to me!

            Why the name Futaba_Webs?:

            <p>
                
                The name Futaba_Webs was inspired from my list of favorite video game characters that are hackers: Futaba from Persona 5, Wrench from WatchDogs 2, 
                and Sombra from Overwatch. The other half of my name, Webs, is inspired from my love of the way of the spider, Spider-Man, my favorite spider(s) being, 
                Spider-Gwen and Superior Spider-Man.
